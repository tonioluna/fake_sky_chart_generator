# Fake Sky Chart Generator
I started writting this code mostly for fun but also because I needed some fake sky charts which, if placed next to itself (to either direction) would be continous. I'm using it as the background for the webpage http://sagdl.org. That is the main reason for it to be fake, as it needs to be built so boundaries are continous.

The development is still WIP, I need to add some additional stuff like deep space objects such as galaxies, star clusters and maybe even some nebula. I may add also names to the stars, fake identifiers to the objets (maybe FGCxxx for Fake General Catalog). However the area that needs more work is the constellation generator. I may also split each constellation algorithm into a separated file.
