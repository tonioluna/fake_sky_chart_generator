# Fake Sky Chart Generator
I started writting this code mostly for fun but also because I needed some fake sky charts which, if placed next to themselves (to either direction) the resulting chart would be continous. I'm using it as the background for the webpage http://sagdl.org. That is the main reason for charts to be fake. Charts from the actual sky would not have continous boundaries if placed next to themselves.

The development is still WIP. I need to add some additional stuff like deep space objects such as galaxies, star clusters and maybe even some nebulae. I may add also names to the stars and fake identifiers to the objets (maybe FGCxxx for Fake General Catalog). However the area that needs more work by far is the constellation generator. Current generators produce pretty much garbage. I may also split each constellation algorithm into a separated files.
