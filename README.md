# Fake Sky Chart Generator
I started writting this code mostly for fun but also because I needed some fake sky charts which, if placed next to themselves (to either direction) the resulting chart would be continous. I'm using it as the background for the webpage http://sagdl.org. That is the main reason for charts to be fake. Charts from the actual sky would not have continous boundaries if placed next to themselves.

The development is still WIP. I need to add some additional stuff like names for stars and deep space objects and even add some nebulae. Object identifiers would be fake as well (maybe FGCxxx for Fake General Catalog). The constellation generator with algorithm Delaunay works ok. It can be improved but it works way better than the previous ones.
